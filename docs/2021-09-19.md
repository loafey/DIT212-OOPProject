## Report


### Discussion items
* ### **Last week**
    So far everything has gone well for everyone. Björn has finished a lot of the groundwork in the Network section.
* ### **Next iteration**
    Next week all classes (except the Game class) in the model should be finished.
    A standard for the communication between the model and the view needs to be decided.
* ### **Player resources**
    Currently the players resources are represented by a `Hashmap<String, Resource>`, will be replaced with Actions(?).
* ### **Card creation**
    These should be created using the factory pattern.
    The cards will hold an Action which either gives a resource or represents an action.
* ### **Model and view communication**
    Samuel and Sebastian will discuss how this will be implemented tomorrow(20/09/21).
