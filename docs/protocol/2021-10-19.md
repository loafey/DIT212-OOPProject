## Report

### Discussion items
* ### **How it's going**
  Everyone know what they're supposed to do. Samuel might need help as he has the   most work left. We're still following the plan from the last meeting.

* ### **Presentation**
  We need around 3 minutes per person. It's probably the easiest if people prepare  their own parts, and then we combine it to a complete presentation. Gabriel prepares the barebones of the presentation

 * Friday 14.15
 * Sunday 20.00

 ## End of meeting
