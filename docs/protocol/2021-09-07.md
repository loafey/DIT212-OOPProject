## Reports
This the first meeting on our own, hence there is not much to stay.
We have implemented a small window in our project, we decided on libgdx as gui, we have produced a couple of user stories, we have decided on how we write our document, where we have keep our user stories and what game to implement.

## Discussion items
* #### **Meeting structure**    
  This week's structure will be our template for the future.

* ### **User Stories**    
  We need to create a couple more user stories and decide on which ones have priority. We should consider colorsorting user stories.

* ### **Who, What and How**
  We need to play the game to really understand what we need.
  Samuel has the responsibility of sketching a gui. Sebastian has the responsibility of creating and sorting user stories. Gabriel and Emmie assist in whatever is needed.
  We expect each person to check our message group ATLEAST twice a day, preferably more.
  If something is bothering someone or has a question, ask in the group chat / bring it up at the meeting.

* ### **Sketching a GUI**
  Design for fullscreen. 2D GUI, maybe 3D if we have more time.
  Check attached picture for initial idea.
