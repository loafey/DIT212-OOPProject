 * Just the same method for client and server.

 * Sends a 4 byte long header to tell the receiver how long the message is. Most
 * sockets have "read-all" function, but if there is a small delay in the
 * middle, this function could think it received the entire message and thus
 * crash the program. For programminglanguages with "read-until", you can do it
 * with a "stop-byte", this ensures that whatever reads has to read exactly this
 * many bytes.
